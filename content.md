## About Intelligent Minds

We are an technology company first, but with a major eduction with a redefined approach to learning. Learning new concepts can be daunting (a nightmare in some cases), even for basic concepts. But this should not be so. Rather learning should be an enjoyble experience. Research has it that when the learning process is fun the outcomes see a 9.. retention rate and 8.. rate of application. Seeing this as a huge problem in education, we designed a new way to learn which uses the power extended reality and the metaverse to remove the abstract barrier to learning and make concepts to life as real as possible. Classes are taught in a virtual space in the metaverse. Leveraging the power of the metaverse, our students don't need to go to school to go through a school. Yes you read that right! We partner with teachers who have excellent performance track record to bring the best value to our students. All this value is packed into a monthly subscription plan or our trimester plan.
